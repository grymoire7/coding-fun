to control the countdown.


## Prompt
Please help me write a javascript appliction for the browser that shows a
countdown timer that displays the time remaining until a specific event or
deadline. The applicaton should accept days, hours, minutes and seconds
remaining until the event (at least one of these should not be zero). It should
display a start/stop button to allow users to control the countdown. The timer
should update in real-time and display the days, hours, minutes, and seconds
remaining.
