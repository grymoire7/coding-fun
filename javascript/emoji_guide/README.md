# Emoji Guide

## Description

Design a responsive grid layout that displays a series of cards or content in a
grid format. The grid should adjust its layout based on the screen size and
should display the cards in a single column on smaller screens and multiple
columns on larger screens. Add hover effects to the cards to make them
interactive.

## Prompt

Please help me write a javascript applcation for the browser that shows a
responsive grid layout that displays a series of cards or content in a grid
format. The grid should contain 10 cards and each card should have an emoji
with a description of the emoji and how it is used underneath. The grid should
adjust its layout based on the screen size and should display the cards in a
single column on smaller screens and multiple columns on larger screens. Add
hover effects to the cards to make them interactive, that is on hover the card
should "wiggle" slightly.
