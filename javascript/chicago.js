// Chicago â€“ Dice Game
// Number of players: 2 or more
// Number of dice: 2
//
// The Chicago dice game is a simple yet fun game. The rules are not very difficult 
// and the game is decided by pure luck, but still it is very addictive. Once you 
// start you might not want to stop to see if you can do better in the next game.
//
// The game is played in 11 rounds, starting with round 2, then going to round 3 
// and continuing until round 12. In each round each player takes his or her turn 
// and rolls both dice, trying to roll the number of that round. For example, in 
// the round with number 2, you aim to roll a 1 on each dice giving you a total of 2.
//
// Every player that rolls the number of the current round gets a point and adds 
// it to his overall score. After all 11 rounds are finished the game ends and the 
// player with the higher number of points is declared the winner.
