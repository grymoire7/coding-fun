# Coding fun

A collection of code to solve small problems or puzzles in various languages.

The code is not always the *best* way to accomplish a give task.  In any given
piece of code we may be playing with language features, structure, algorithms,
etc.  It's also light on exception handling.  So... please don't judge it too harshly.
It's not production code.
