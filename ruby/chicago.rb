# Chicago â€“ Dice Game
# Number of players: 2 or more
# Number of dice: 2
#
# The Chicago dice game is a simple yet fun game. The rules are not very difficult 
# and the game is decided by pure luck, but still it is very addictive. Once you 
# start you might not want to stop to see if you can do better in the next game.
#
# The game is played in 11 rounds, starting with round 2, then going to round 3 
# and continuing until round 12. In each round each player takes his or her turn 
# and rolls both dice, trying to roll the number of that round. For example, in 
# the round with number 2, you aim to roll a 1 on each dice giving you a total of 2.
#
# Every player that rolls the number of the current round gets a point and adds 
# it to his overall score. After all 11 rounds are finished the game ends and the 
# player with the higher number of points is declared the winner.
