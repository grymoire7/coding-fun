# You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically
# for programmers. In your efforts to find a clue, youâ€™ve found a
# binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that
# it must be an encrypted message. After some thought, your first
# guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the
# character with the corresponding extended ASCII code.
#
# Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.
#
# Example:
# For code = "010010000110010101101100011011000110111100100001", the output should be
# messageFromBinaryCode(code) = "Hello!".
